Hello, I’m @incorrectMethod

- I’m a Mechatronic Engineer focused on embedded electronic design through to functioning prototypes. I am a jack of all trades and have good networks for further expertise.
- I’m always learning and have gained reasonable experience in C++ with freeRTOS, Java app development and some Python. Additionally I have decent experience with multiple CAD tools, hardware manufacturing and test evaluation.
- I’d like to collaborate on automotive products and automation. I would like more experience with control systems above the normal PID feedback (MIMO and complex environments).

Feel free to contact me via my outdated website [mechlabs.com.au](mechlabs.com.au) or via email to [info@mechlabs.com.au](mailto:info@mechlabs.com.au).
